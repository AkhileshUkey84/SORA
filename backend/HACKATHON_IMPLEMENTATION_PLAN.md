---

## **Phase 3: Proactive Insight Discovery (4-5 hours)**

### 3.1 **Enhanced Insight Agent**
**Files to modify**: `agents/insight_agent.py`

**Current State**: Statistical pattern detection (outliers, correlations, trends)
**Target State**: Business-aware proactive insights with follow-up suggestions

**Improvements**:
- Pattern recognition engine with business context
- Next-question prediction based on insights
- Automatic anomaly investigation
- Insight importance scoring with explanations

### 3.2 **Business Context Service** (New)
**Files to create**: `services/business_context_service.py`

**Purpose**: Provide domain-aware insights and suggestions

**Features**:

---

## **Phase 4: Transparent Security Theater (2-3 hours)**

### 4.1 **Enhanced Validator Agent**
**Files to modify**: `agents/validator_agent.py`

**Current State**: Basic SQL validation with simple explanations
**Target State**: Human-readable security explanations with policy references

**Improvements**:
- Detailed modification explanations
- Policy constitution display
- Educational security messaging
- Transparent guardrail reasoning

### 4.2 **Security Policy Service** (New)
**Files to create**: `services/security_policy_service.py`

**Purpose**: Provide clear, educational security explanations

**Features**:
- Policy constitution management
- Human-readable explanations
- Security education messages
- Compliance reporting

---

## **Phase 5: Schema-Aware Intelligence (2-3 hours)**

### 5.1 **Enhanced Database Service**
**Files to modify**: `services/database_service.py`

**Current State**: Basic DuckDB operations
**Target State**: Schema-intelligent operations with type validation

**Improvements**:
- Intelligent type-mismatch handling
- Schema-aware operation suggestions
- Data type compatibility checking
- Smart column recommendations

### 5.2 **Semantic Layer Enhancement**
**Files to modify**: `services/semantic_layer_service.py`

**Current State**: Likely basic (need to check implementation)
**Target State**: Full semantic understanding of data relationships

**Improvements**:
- Column relationship mapping
- Business term translation
- Metric calculation rules
- Join suggestion intelligence

---

## **Phase 6: Demo-Ready Differentiators (3-4 hours)**

### 6.1 **Real-Time Intelligence Dashboard** (New)
**Files to create**: `services/intelligence_dashboard_service.py`

**Purpose**: Show AI reasoning process transparently for judges

**Features**:
- Query analysis breakdown
- Confidence score display
- Processing cost tracking
- Counterfactual test results

### 6.2 **Provenance Service Enhancement**
**Files to modify**: `agents/lineage_agent.py`

**Current State**: Basic lineage tracking
**Target State**: Full reproducibility with provenance receipts

**Improvements**:
- Query hash generation
- Execution replay capabilities
- Version tracking
- Reproducibility validation
