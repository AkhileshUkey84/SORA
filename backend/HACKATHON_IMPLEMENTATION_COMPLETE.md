## 🏗️ **Integration Points**

Your existing system already handles the core pipeline. The new intelligence layer integrates at these points:

### **Enhanced Agent Orchestrator** (Update needed)
```python
# services/agent_orchestrator.py - Add intelligence layer
async def process_query_with_intelligence(self, query: str, context: AgentContext):
    # 1. Start reasoning session (dashboard)
    session = intelligence_dashboard.start_session(context.session_id, query)
    
    # 2. Enhanced memory and planning
    memory_result = await memory_agent.process(context)  # Now entity-aware
    planner_result = await planner_agent.process(context)  # Now business-aware
    
    # 3. Business context detection
    domain, confidence = business_context.detect_domain(query, context.metadata)
    
    # 4. Execute with enhanced validation
    results = await self.execute_pipeline(context)
    
    # 5. Generate insights and suggestions
    insights = await insight_agent.process(context, results=results, domain=domain)
    suggestions = await suggestion_agent.process(context, results=results, insights=insights)
    
    # 6. Complete reasoning session
    await intelligence_dashboard.complete_session(
        session.session_id, results, insights, suggestions
    )
    
    return EnhancedQueryResponse(
        success=True,
        data=results,
        insights=insights,
        suggestions=suggestions,
        business_context=business_context_response,
        reasoning_explanation=session.generate_explanation()
    )
```
